
### A boilerplate for exploring Svelte and Storybook

[Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) is a new component framework that runs at build time, converting your components into highly efficient imperative code that surgically updates the DOM. With [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) you can visualize different states of your UI components and develop them outside of your application.

This boilerplate was developed to understand how both these libraries would work within a build environment using Webpack, SASS and Nunjucls templating.
